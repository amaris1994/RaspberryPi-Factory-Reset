# Factory Reset Your Raspbian OS    

### Description:   
In the normal process to reset or restore the Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian), you need to unplug the SD Card, format the card, re-write the OS image and plug it back again.  If you are doing some testing or development, it can be a pain to go over this process again. This git contains the scripts using which you can create a Raspberry Pi OS image which has an option to factory reset the OS without plugging out the SD Card.

## Usage:   

1. Clone the git using:   
```
git clone https://github.com/shivasiddharth/RaspberryPi-Factory-Reset  
```   

2. Download your preferred image, unzip them and place them in the files directory.   

3. Change directory using:  
```   
cd /home/${USER}/RaspberryPi-Factory-Reset/files/   
```   

4. Make the script executable using:   
```   
sudo chmod +x ./create-factory-reset.sh  
```   

5. Execute the script using:   
```   
sudo ./create-factory-reset.sh  
```    

6. Copy the created image and write it to the SD Card and enjoy.    

7. Usage to factory reset:   
```  
sudo su -   
/boot/factory_reset --reset    
```
